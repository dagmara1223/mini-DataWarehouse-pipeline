# mini-datawarehouse-pipeline
End-to-end Data Warehouse pipeline built with Python and MySQL. The project simulates a real-world data engineering workflow: raw CSV data ingestion, staging layer transformations, star schema modeling (fact and dimension tables), and incremental loading with basic Change Data Capture (CDC).
